BeautifulSoup is a Python library used for web scraping. It helps parse HTML and XML documents 
making it easy to navigate and extract specific parts of a webpage.

Steps involved in web scraping:

1.Send an HTTP Request: Use the requests library to send a request to the webpage URL and get the HTML
    content in response.
2.Parse the HTML Content: Use a parser like html.parser or html5lib to convert the raw HTML into a 
    structured format (parse tree).
3.Extract Data: Use BeautifulSoup to navigate the parse tree and extract the required data using tags,
    classes, or IDs.
